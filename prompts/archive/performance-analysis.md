Cursor AI-Assisted Code Review Workflow
1. Performance Analysis Approach

Leverage AI to identify performance bottlenecks
Look for patterns in rendering and event handling
Focus on components with high re-render frequencies
Analyze dependency chains and unnecessary computations
2. Refactoring Strategy

Use AI to suggest memoization techniques
Identify opportunities for component decomposition
Detect potential memory leaks or inefficient state management
Recommend more efficient data structures or algorithms
3. Code Quality Insights

Evaluate code complexity and cognitive load
Suggest cleaner, more declarative implementations
Highlight potential anti-patterns
Recommend best practices for React, Firebase, and Konva integration
4. Performance Optimization Heuristics

Detect unnecessary re-renders
Identify expensive computations
Suggest lazy loading strategies
Recommend event handling optimizations
